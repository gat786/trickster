# An idea for an app

There are some parts which we want this app to have. this app will enable tricksters fighters and athletes to create their profiles and then they can create their profiles with beautiful videos as well as photos of themselves as well as they can rate others. If a person feels that they should have a competition with another  user there should be a button which enables them to challenge others and create a match between them upon a decided location which both of them should agree.

1. Users should be able to create their profiles.
2. They can check others profiles as well.
3. They can like others photos as well as videos.
4. Each profile should have a message as well as follow and throw a challenge button.
5. After a challenge is thrown it should appear in the message box of person to which the challenge is thrown at.
6. The challenge message should have accept and reject buttons.
7. Upon Declining the challenge the person who challenged should be informated by somewhat same kind of message.
8. If the challenge was accepted then both the challenger and acceptor should agree upon a location which has to be challenge location.
9. After agreeing upon location the challenge should be visible in feed through which other users can see the challenge and can join the action.
